# Mandatory Vehicle Insurance - Classification

The goal is to decrease the number of interactions that do not result in contract signings and prioritize those who have higher chance of being a new customer.

## Issue

There is a Toyota Project which is running since 2 years. This project means that all the new Toyota customersâ€™ contacts are provided to only this company. There is currently 85% rejection rate. The problem is that when they get the list on a weekly basis they can not call everyone on time (time sensitive that they find other company), and they can not decide who could be the potential new customer, so they can not prioritize them. The company invests significant resources into contacting potential customers who are unlikely to sign a contract, leading to wasted efforts, high costs, missing other customers and potential negative reviews.

## Business Casse

The implementation of a machine learning model based program will help to identify the potential customers, so the sales team can focus on those who are more likely to sign a contract, reducing wasted efforts and time on those with a low probability of conversion. The sales call center is operating with a high rate of rejection on the Toyota project around 85% and the goal is to reduce this to 75%, which means also increasing the successful call rate with 10%.

## Goal

Our goal for this project is to decrease the number of those sales efforts and costs that are ending without insurance contract. Now the focus in on the Toyota Project, but in the future the model could be widened to help the whole sales team if it will prove its success.
Metrics: the rate of signed contracts (%), Customer Acquisition Cost, rejection rate (%)

## Expected deliverables

An application that gets a csv file and gives back a list with the Potential customers.
